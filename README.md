# RestApiVelvetrade

A REST API for the Velvetrade website. Uses Spring boot to create models of Users,Groups, Posting, and  Chats and then stores or reads from a database on firebase.
The website in general allows users to trade objects they have created in groups or in public. Users can post objects they have and post any objects they are looking for.
